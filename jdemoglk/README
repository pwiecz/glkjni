JDemoGlk: A GlkJNI-compatible Java frontend
(c) 2009 Edward McCardell <edward.mccardell@gmail.com>

JDemoGlk is a bare-bones example implementation of a Java frontend that
can be used with GlkJNI.

* Using

To use JDemoGlk as the frontend for GlkJNI programs, copy the JAR file
to a directory of your choice and pass the location as a command-line
argument to the Glk program, like so:

    glulxe -Djava.class.path=/path/to/jdemoglk.jar foo.gblorb
